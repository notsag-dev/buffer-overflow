# Buffer overflow
From [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Buffer_Overflow):
> A buffer overflow condition exists when a program attempts to put more data in a buffer than it can hold or when a program attempts to put data in a memory area past a buffer. In this case, a buffer is a sequential section of memory allocated to contain anything from a character string to an array of integers. Writing outside the bounds of a block of allocated memory can corrupt data, crash the program, or cause the execution of malicious code.

Low memory addresses

## Stack
The stack, also known as the call stack, is a data structure located in the RAM memory that allows functions to call each other and also to store their local variables. // reword this

Let's say a function F1 calls the function F2, and the function F2 calls the function F3. Also, each function i defines a local variable VFi. Let's see what the stack would look like for each 

// TODO FINISH EXAMPLE

## Example
This is a classic example of a C program that is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks:
```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  char buffer[20];
  strcpy(buffer, argv[1]);
  return 0;
}
```

This program is vulnerable because the function `strcpy` is memory unsafe: if the argument's length is greater than 20 it will overwrite the contiguous memory addresses. Does it sound familiar already? üòè Let's move on.

First, compile the program:
```bash
gcc -g bufferOverflow.c
```
This should have generated an output file, in our case the default one `a.out` (use `-o` to change output name).

Note also the -g flag, which generates debug info to be used with the [gdb debugger](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/).

Run the output using the debugger:
```bash
gdb a.out
```

The command `list` should print out the source code of `bufferOverflow.c`:
```C
(gdb) list
1	#include <stdio.h>
2	#include <string.h>
3
4	int main(int argc, char **argv) {
5	  char buffer[20];
6	  strcpy(buffer, argv[1]);
7	  return 0;
8	}
```

Run `disas main` to see the assembly code:
```assembly
(gdb) disas main
